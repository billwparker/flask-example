# Flask Example

## This example shows

- Getting user inputted values from an html form into the app.py.
- How to use those values in the "pickled" model that had been saved from a Jupyter notebook.
- Then displaying that prediction back on the HTML page


** Notice: This isn't meant to be an example of a Final Project or an example of a robust machine learning model, but only the mechanics of how to save a model and use it in Flask and get values in Flask and report the results in the HTML to the user.

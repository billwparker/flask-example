# Flask Example

## This example shows

### Charts
- Getting user selected values from dropdowns, passing those values back to the API endpoints in app.py that gets data from the database and then gets called by the javascript for charts - data.html
- Shows the use of a Javascript datatable

### Machine Learning
- Getting user inputted values from an html form into the app.py - analysis.html.
- How to use those values in the "pickled" model that had been saved from a Jupyter notebook.
- Then displaying that prediction back on the HTML page


** Notice: This isn't meant to be an example of a Final Project or an example of a robust machine learning model, but only the mechanics of how to save a model and use it in Flask and get values in Flask and report the results in the HTML to the user.
